## **Warning: Limited User Experience Expected**
**Eagerly welcome contribution**

## Known Issues
- [ ] Clicking a link in the friends activity tab will fire a page refresh instead of a React-like dom modification, which will stop the playback.
- [ ] Play button and More button is not functioning. Possibly caused by raw HTML text injection, a object-based element creation might solve this issue.
- [ ] Button SVG copied from the Device List button.
- [ ] The case of multiple artist in a single track is not considered.
